		<p>
		Bread is one of the most basic and ancient food products, dating back thousands of years; people were making bread even before cultivating crops.
		Bread can essentially be made with flour, yeast and water. 
		However, the earliest forms of bread only used ground grain and water; it was the ancient Egyptians who put yeast in their bread. 
		Of course, just flour, water and yeast would make very bland and tasteless bread. 
		Now in the modern age all kinds of things have been added to bread, from seeds to sausages there are countless varieties of bread. 
		I, myself, have dabbled in the occasional bread making and it all started with dinner rolls.

		Ah, the bread that kicked off the baking debacle. 
		It all started a couple months into the pandemic; my dear mother asked me to make something for breakfast and one thing led to another and I baked dinner rolls. 
		They were such a hit that we had dinner rolls for breakfast for two weeks.
		</p>
		<h3>Variations</h3>
		<p>
		Eventually as I started baking more I had many left over miscellaneous ingredients. 
		A couple of which I used to make some other form of bread roll, dinner rolls 2 electric boogaloo. 
		I had leftover cream cheese from making <a href="cakes.html#cheesecake">cheesecake</a>, evaporated milk from <a href="piesandtarts.html#eggtarts">egg tarts</a> and other leftover ingredients which I used to make more bread. 
		I would say they turned out well but I do still prefer the classic dinner rolls.

		<p>
		My mother once brought home a huge packet of hotdogs from Costco, and like any reasonable person would, I decided to wrap bread around it. 
		My original intent was to try to recreate the sausage buns from a Chinese bakery but the bread those bakeries use is not the same as dinner rolls and I hadn&rsquo;t found a recipe at the time for this kind of bread. To this day I haven&rsquo;t successfully recreated Chinese bakery bread. 
		Sausage buns are essentially hotdogs wrapped in bread, not particularly mind blowing but they did spice up breakfast for that week, another taste and texture instead of just bread.

		Another classic bun from Chinese bakeries. 
		I believe it was my brother who requested this bun to be made. 
		In Mandarin it is pronounced &ldquo;bo luo bao&rdquo;, and in Cantonese &ldquo;bo lo baau.&rdquo; 
		The bun has a cookie-like topping that resembles a pineapple, hence the name. 
		It is an adored food of my siblings. 
		Also, one of my brother&rsquo;s friends wrote a

		on the bun and it even includes a recipe for them at the end. 
		</p>
		<h3>Additions</h3>
		<p>
		There are a few prominent additions to pineapple buns. 
		Sometimes these buns are stuffed with custard or red bean paste and serving with a pad of butter is also common. 
		When I was younger, my sister would call out &ldquo;treasure&rdquo; whenever she bit into a fresh bun and found custard. 
		And I was introduced to butter in buns when my brother took us out to eat and we got a pineapple bun with butter and hong kong style milk tea.

		<p>Garlic plus bread, what's there more to say about garlic bread.</p>
		<h3>A Rant About Garlic Bread</h3>
		<p>
		To be completely honest, making garlic bread from scratch is just not worth the time and effort. 
		First off, I hate working with any kind of oil or butter. 
		They make your hands all greasy and cutting and measuring butter with a scale is a hassle. 
		The spread that gives the garlic uses both and a microwave, which I am afraid of due to a situation that involved a frozen juice box and fire. 
		Garlic is also a pain, cutting cloves upon cloves of garlic is tedious and leaves a weird sticky residue on your hands. 
		Brushing the bread with the garlic oil was another nightmare. The food brush I have was utterly useless, and even with the brush I still got my hands greasy. 
		Also, slicing bread is quite annoying. 
		I&rsquo;ve never sliced bread until this baking project and it is no easy feat. 
		It left so many crumbs and half of the slices were utterly deformed, I do not recommend slicing your own bread. 
		And to top it all off I once forgot to microwave the garlic before putting it on the bread and there were chunks of raw garlic. 
		Store bought or professionally made garlic bread is way better and worth your time.
