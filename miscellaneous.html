		<p>
		Fresh off the heels of the mooncakes, I had a bunch of extra lye water and one thing you can make with lye water is noodles. 
		</p>
		<h3>Chunky Noodles</h3>
		<p>
		Noodles are a lot harder to make than it seems. 
		The dough is tough and annoying to stretch out. 
		My noodles ended up chunky and more like udon noodles instead of the thinner noodles that I was aiming for.

		<h2 id="spinachpizza">Spinach Pizza</h2>
<!--id for links-->
		<p>
		Spinach pizza is my favourite type of pizza. 
		It has greens so one can think they are healthy but tastes amazing. 
		I added extra spinach to my pizza to make it &ldquo;healthier&rsquo;.

		<h2 id="ricottaravioli">Ricotta Ravioli</h2>
<!--id for links-->
		<p>
		I had extra parmesan and ricotta from the <a href="#spinachpizza">spinach pizza</a>, so I tried my hand at pasta. 
		</p>
		<h3>Extra Thick Ravioli</h3>
		<p>
		Pasta is just as hard to make as noodles. 
		I also don&rsquo;t have a pasta machine so extra thick ravioli is. 
		The filling was nice and the pasta tasted fine.

		<h2 id="scallionpancakes">Scallion Pancakes</h2>
<!--id for links-->
		<p>
		My sister seems to have an obsession with pancakes. 
		I have no idea as to what could have spurred the flat cake mania. 
		My mother bought pancake mix once and it was pancakes for breakfast every weekend. 
		My mother bought potatoes and bam potato pancakes.  
		My sister didn&rsquo;t actually fry the pancakes but shredded the potatoes; big mistake, she took forever to shred them. 
		I also accidentally opened the wrong lid for the pepper and a whole pile slipped out and I scared my sister off of pepper. 
		To this day she still shudders at the sight of me holding pepper. 
		Then my mother bought a whole lot of green onions for dumplings and of course my sister wanted to make scallion pancakes.
