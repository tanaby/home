		I have a long standing feud with pies. 
		The first time I ever made a pie was a complete disaster. 
		I was trying to make pumpkin pie. 
		The crust was bland and the filling raw and wouldn&rsquo;t set. 
		I ate horrible pumpkin pie for a whole week. 
		Pies use the one ingredient I hate making the most, butter. 
		If the butter is too cold, it&rsquo;s hard to cut, but every ingredient needs to be as cold as possible to make a pie crust. 
		You can&rsquo;t knead a pie crust too long or you&rsquo;ll ruin it and don&rsquo;t forget that if the crust is too cold it&rsquo;ll be hard to roll out. 
		Pie crusts are just so finicky and annoying to work with and by the end of it you&rsquo;ll have greasy and caked in flour hands.

		The only reason I subjected myself to the torturous task of making a pie is because my dear mother brought home a fat stick of lard. 
		I don&rsquo;t know why she bought it, maybe she saw the pie on the front and thought it was a pie crust but anyhow I was stuck with a stick of lard sneering at me every time I looked in the fridge. 
		Then I finally caved, and I made an apple pie; it was one of the worst decisions I&rsquo;ve made.

		I am not a masochist, only a person who does not waste ingredients. 
		The apple pie did not fully consume the fat chunk of lard and there was still some butter in my fridge. 
		So, logically: blueberry handheld pies.
		</p>
		<h3>Catastrophic Cinnamon</h3>
		<p>
		The worst decision made with these pies, excluding the whole endeavour in general, is five spice powder. 
		The recipe involved cinnamon; I usually ignore spices I don&rsquo;t have on hand but for some deluded reason I decided to try and replace cinnamon with five spice powder. 
		I don&rsquo;t usually work with spices outside of black pepper, so I know nothing about spices and their flavour. 
		Five spice powder does have cinnamon in it but also some other stuff. 
		The powder would have probably not affected the filling if not for my greasy, buttery fingers; I added way too much powder and the pies suffered. 
		If not for the funky blueberry filling, everything else otherwise tasted fine; even the crust wasn&rsquo;t as bland and was even a tad bit flaky.

		<p>
		Another classic piece of food from Chinese bakeries, pronounced &ldquo;dan ta&rdquo; or &ldquo;daan taat&rdquo; in Mandarin and Cantonese, respectively. 
		Egg tarts have a flaky and delectable crust and silky, smooth sweet custard. 
		I remember when I was younger my mom would come back home and sometimes be carrying a white plastic bag with a small rectangular cardboard box. 
		Then inside that dainty little box, four beautiful little egg tarts. 
		I would gobble mine like someone would steal it if I didn&rsquo;t eat fast enough; then my mom would yell at me for all the crumbs I left. 
		</p>
		<h3>Crusty Crusts</h3>
		<p>
		My batch of tarts was not exactly like the bakeries but it was not not successful. 
		First off I only had a muffin tin and not any liners or metal tins. 
		Thus my tarts weren&rsquo;t as aesthetically pleasing and were deeper than their store counterparts. 
		The custard turned out splendid, the crust not so much. 
		They tasted and felt very much like the pumpkin pie crust I made previously. 
		I&rsquo;m sure if I ever revisit these again, the tarts will turn out nicely.
