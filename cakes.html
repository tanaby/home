		<p>
		A classic dessert with many varieties, just like bread in a way. 
		There are extravagant cakes for special occasions and more simple cakes for a snack. 
		I&rsquo;ve had many bad and good experiences with cakes while both eating and making them. 
		I once went to a party that had a cake from Costco and there was so much frosting. 
		To my luck, I had received a slice absolutely caked with icing and let&rsquo;s just say that little experience scared me off of icing for a long time. 
		On the other hand <a href="https://daango.com/">Daan Go Cake Lab</a> has some of the most beautiful and delicious cakes I&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of consuming. 
		Almost all cakes I&rsquo;ve made have had something go wrong, whether it be a fridge cleaning disaster or funky tasting sugar. 
		Maybe cakes and I are just not meant to be.

		<h3>Bread or Cake?</h3>
		<p>
		Technically banana bread qualifies as cake and not bread. 
		The main difference between the two is the addition of yeast. 
		Bread is made up of flour, water and yeast, a leavening agent, that causes bread to rise. 
		Cake on the other hand does typically use baking powder which is also a leavening agent but cake is not rested to rise. 
		Banana bread does not use yeast, instead baking powder; thus should be classified as cake.

		I first made cheesecake for my birthday. 
		What makes cheesecake challenging is getting the cake not to crack. 
		My cake did in fact sustain cracks and like how I solve many of my mistakes, I covered it with a thick layer of blueberry sauce. 
		There are two types of cheesecake, New York style and Japanese. 
		The only type of cheesecake I have made are the New York style. 
		I personally prefer the New York style. 
		I love crusts in cakes and the buttery graham cracker bottom is a great pairing with the creamy cheesecake top. 
		I will probably in the future try my hand at the Japanese style cheesecake, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time.

<!--id for links-->
		<p>
		The cake that was born from excess heavy cream from making pineapple buns. 
		Of course the leftover ingredients strike again. 
		I have never not bought ingredients and used them all in one recipe. 
		I must also say whipped cream is very finicky and hard to smooth out and takes surprisingly long time to form even with an electric hand mixer. 
		Other than that there&rsquo;s not much to say about strawberry shortcakes.

		<h2 id="mangomoussecake">Mango Mousse Cake</h2>
<!--id for links-->
		<p>
		One of my most ambitious endeavours to date. 
		I made a mango mousse cake for my mother&rsquo;s birthday. 
		It has a bottom sponge cake layer, a thick layer of mango mousse and was supposed to have a jello top with fruit as decoration.
		</p>
		<h3>Mishaps</h3>
		<p>
		A slew of problems came with this cake. 
		Firstly, the mousse hardly tasted like mango, which was forgivable since the mousse was still delicious. 
		However, there was another complication with the mousse; there were tiny chunks of gelatin. 
		I didn&rsquo;t have a good whisk at the time and didn&rsquo;t strain the mixture before setting it. 
		The worst mishap was the whole jello top. 
		The entire jello decoration failed. 
		I had used a cheesecake pan as it was the only pan tall enough but the jello leaked through before properly setting, leaving a whole mess in my fridge. 
		To make things worse it had seeped into the sponge bottom layer and the sponge cake became a soggy mess. 
		To fix the ugly residue on the top, I covered it with berries. 
		The cake did end up tasting good, maybe I&rsquo;ll revisit this cake in the future and hope everything goes smoothly.

		<h2 id="carrotwalnutcake">Carrot Walnut Cake</h2>
<!--id for links-->
		<p>
		This cake was not for anything special just created from boredom, a sack of walnuts and some carrots. 
		For some reason, my mother always has a sack of something in our fridge, whether it be apples, dates, garlic, or walnuts. 
		The idea came to me as I was rummaging through our fridge looking for something to eat and so I acted on the idea and made a carrot walnut cake
		</p>
		<h3>Flavour?</h3>
		<p>
		I regret not levelling the cake before coating the top with frosting as the cake ended up looking quite top heaving in the cross section. 
		Oh, but something bigger had to go wrong. 
		The powder sugar I&rsquo;d used to make the icing had been in a cupboard with sacks and sacks of ginseng and had absorbed the ginseng-ness of the ginseng, leaving some very odd tasting icing sugar.
